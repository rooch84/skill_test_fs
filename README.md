# Full-Stack Development Challenge

Retrieve a publicly-available crime dataset (e.g., [UK police data](https://data.police.uk/) or [Seattle public safety data](https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/SPD-Crime-Data-2008-Present/tazs-3rd5)) and create a Typescript React app that shows the data in two views: (i) a geographical map, and (ii) one other visualisation of your choice (e.g., a bar chart).

Make the data available in a WebApp with data from a REST API service developed in .NET.

Your source code should be available on GitHub along with instructions in the readme on how to build and run the application.

## What we are looking for

- Clear, well-written code.
- Implementing React best practices.
- A well-presented web app with good usability.

## Extra credit

- Host the site in the cloud.


## Some additional instructions

1) Use a professional approach of planning, design, implementation. Document your approach (README please), and decide yourself in how to show that your solution does what it should.
  
2) There is no right or wrong here, but be prepared to comment on and argue for the choices that you have made.

3) Treat this like an agile project and set yourself a timeframe to deliver this task and stick to it. The most important aspect is to deliver something in your version 1 that works and can be extended
